        <p>I'm from Tennessee and I'm in this class to expand
        <br>my dev skills to include websites. My overall goal
        <br>for this class is to have a website I can use as a portfolio.
        <br>I like exploring everything that Colorado has to offer,
        <br>making, and playing video games.
